# Advent of Code 2023

This is my repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023!
Each day has its own folder, and within most the seperate parts of the task are separated too.

Each part is its own cargo project, so can be run with `cargo run` if you have cargo installed (apart from the first day which was a small Python script).

Please create an issue or send me a message if there are any optimizations or refactors for the Rust code so that I may LEARN.
